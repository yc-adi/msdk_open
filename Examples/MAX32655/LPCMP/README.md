## Description

A basic getting started program.

This version of Hello_World prints an incrementing count to the console UART and toggles a GPIO (P1.14 - LED1) once every 500 ms.


## Software

### Project Usage

Universal instructions on building, flashing, and debugging this project can be found in the **[MSDK User Guide](https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/)**.

### Project-Specific Build Notes

* This project comes pre-configured for the MAX32655EVKIT.  See [Board Support Packages](https://analog-devices-msdk.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/#board-support-packages) in the MSDK User Guide for instructions on changing the target board.

## Required Connections
If using the MAX32655EVKIT (EvKit\_V1):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect pins JP4(RX_SEL) and JP5(TX_SEL) to RX0 and TX0  header.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
***********Hello World!***********

LED1 on P1.14 toggles every 500 ms

Count = 0
Count = 1
Count = 2
Count = 3
```
